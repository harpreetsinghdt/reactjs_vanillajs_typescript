# Reactjs + TypeScript

### TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.

### TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### TypeScript is available as a package on the npm registry available as "typescript".

### You will need a copy of Node.js as an environment to run the package. Then you use a dependency manager like npm, yarn or pnpm to download TypeScript into your project.

### To install Typescript via npm on your current project only run:

```
npm install typescript
```

### All of these dependency managers support lockfiles, ensuring that everyone on your team is using the same version of the language. You can then run the TypeScript compiler using one of the following commands:

```
npx tsc
```

### To install Typescript via npm on your system globally run:

### You can use npm to install TypeScript globally, this means that you can use the tsc command anywhere in your terminal.

```
npm install -g typescript
```

### To initiate empty package.json file run:

```
npm init -y
```

#### -y flag is used to say yes to all questions asked while prompting
