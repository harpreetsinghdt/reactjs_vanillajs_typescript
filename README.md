# Reactjs + TypeScript

### TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.

### TypeScript is a superset to JavaScript.

### TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### TypeScript is available as a package on the npm registry available as "typescript".

### You will need a copy of Node.js as an environment to run the package. Then you use a dependency manager like npm, yarn or pnpm to download TypeScript into your project.

### To install Typescript via npm on your current project only run:

```
npm install typescript
```

### All of these dependency managers support lockfiles, ensuring that everyone on your team is using the same version of the language. You can then run the TypeScript compiler using one of the following commands:

```
npx tsc
```

### To install Typescript via npm on your system globally run:

### You can use npm to install TypeScript globally, this means that you can use the tsc command anywhere in your terminal.

```
npm install -g typescript
```

### To initiate empty package.json file run:

```
npm init -y
```

#### Flag "-y" with npm init is used to say yes to all questions asked while prompting

```
When we say "TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript," it means that TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding new features and capabilities. Specifically:

All JavaScript is TypeScript: Any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. You can take any JavaScript code and rename the file from .js to .ts, and it will still work the same way in TypeScript.

Additional Features: TypeScript introduces new features that are not present in JavaScript. These include static typing, interfaces, enums, and more. These features help developers write more robust, maintainable, and error-free code.

Static Typing: One of the most significant additions in TypeScript is static typing. This allows developers to define the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. The TypeScript compiler can then catch type-related errors at compile time, before the code is run.

Type Inference: TypeScript can infer types based on the code, which means you don't always have to explicitly define types.

Tooling and IDE Support: TypeScript provides better tooling and IDE support, with features like autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring.

To summarize, TypeScript builds on top of JavaScript by adding extra features that help in catching errors early, improving code quality, and enhancing the development experience, while still being fully compatible with existing JavaScript code.
